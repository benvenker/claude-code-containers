# Context-Aware Processing Feature

## Overview
Implementation of Phase 4.1 - Context-Aware Processing for GitLab integration. This feature enhances the existing GitLab webhook processing to provide more intelligent context extraction and response formatting.

## Requirements from Plan.md

### 4.1 Context-Aware Processing
- [ ] Smart context extraction
  - [ ] Extract relevant code context for comments
  - [ ] Include file/line information for MR comments
  - [ ] Add discussion thread context
- [ ] Intelligent response formatting
  - [ ] Format responses based on trigger type
  - [ ] Add code suggestions for MR comments
  - [ ] Include relevant links and references

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing GitLab Processing
The current GitLab integration (Phase 3 complete) supports:
- Issue processing with basic context (title, description, author)
- Comment processing with @duo-agent parsing
- MR processing with description parsing
- Basic container environment variable passing

### Areas for Enhancement
1. **Limited Code Context**: MR comments don't include file/line information
2. **Basic Response Formatting**: All responses use generic formatting
3. **No Thread Context**: Comments don't include discussion history
4. **Missing Code Suggestions**: No syntax highlighting or code formatting
5. **No Link References**: Responses don't include relevant GitLab links

## Implementation Strategy

### Smart Context Extraction
1. **File/Line Information**: Extract position data from GitLab webhook payloads
2. **Code Context**: Fetch surrounding code lines for MR comments
3. **Discussion Thread**: Retrieve comment history for threaded responses
4. **Project Context**: Include relevant project information and links

### Intelligent Response Formatting
1. **Trigger-Based Templates**: Different formatting for issues vs comments vs MRs
2. **Code Syntax Highlighting**: Proper markdown formatting for code snippets
3. **Reference Links**: Include links to relevant GitLab resources
4. **Action Suggestions**: Provide actionable next steps

## TDD Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Smart Context Extraction
- Test file/line information extraction from MR comment webhooks
- Test code context retrieval from GitLab API
- Test discussion thread context gathering

### Phase 2: Intelligent Response Formatting
- Test trigger-based response formatting
- Test code suggestion formatting
- Test link reference inclusion

### Phase 3: Integration & Optimization
- Test end-to-end context-aware processing
- Test performance optimizations
- Test error handling

## Implementation Notes
- Build on existing GitLab webhook handlers
- Extend container processing with enhanced context
- Use GitLab API for additional context retrieval
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Success Criteria
- MR comments include file/line information when available
- Code context is extracted and formatted properly
- Discussion thread context is included in responses
- Responses are formatted based on trigger type
- Code suggestions are highlighted and actionable
- Relevant GitLab links are included in responses
