# Context-Aware Processing Feature

## Overview
Implementation of Phase 4.1 - Context-Aware Processing for GitLab integration. This feature enhances the existing GitLab webhook processing to provide more intelligent context extraction and response formatting.

## Requirements from Plan.md

### 4.1 Context-Aware Processing
- [ ] Smart context extraction
  - [ ] Extract relevant code context for comments
  - [ ] Include file/line information for MR comments
  - [ ] Add discussion thread context
- [ ] Intelligent response formatting
  - [ ] Format responses based on trigger type
  - [ ] Add code suggestions for MR comments
  - [ ] Include relevant links and references

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing GitLab Processing
The current GitLab integration (Phase 3 complete) supports:
- Issue processing with basic context (title, description, author)
- Comment processing with @duo-agent parsing
- MR processing with description parsing
- Basic container environment variable passing

### Areas for Enhancement
1. **Limited Code Context**: MR comments don't include file/line information
2. **Basic Response Formatting**: All responses use generic formatting
3. **No Thread Context**: Comments don't include discussion history
4. **Missing Code Suggestions**: No syntax highlighting or code formatting
5. **No Link References**: Responses don't include relevant GitLab links

## Implementation Strategy

### Smart Context Extraction
1. **File/Line Information**: Extract position data from GitLab webhook payloads
2. **Code Context**: Fetch surrounding code lines for MR comments
3. **Discussion Thread**: Retrieve comment history for threaded responses
4. **Project Context**: Include relevant project information and links

### Intelligent Response Formatting
1. **Trigger-Based Templates**: Different formatting for issues vs comments vs MRs
2. **Code Syntax Highlighting**: Proper markdown formatting for code snippets
3. **Reference Links**: Include links to relevant GitLab resources
4. **Action Suggestions**: Provide actionable next steps

## TDD Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Smart Context Extraction
- Test file/line information extraction from MR comment webhooks
- Test code context retrieval from GitLab API
- Test discussion thread context gathering

### Phase 2: Intelligent Response Formatting
- Test trigger-based response formatting
- Test code suggestion formatting
- Test link reference inclusion

### Phase 3: Integration & Optimization
- Test end-to-end context-aware processing
- Test performance optimizations
- Test error handling

## Implementation Status

### ✅ COMPLETED (Phase 4.1)
- **Smart Context Extraction**: ✅ Complete with file/line information extraction
- **Enhanced Response Formatting**: ✅ Complete with syntax highlighting and collapsible sections
- **Discussion Thread Context**: ✅ Complete with historical comment threading
- **GitLab URL References**: ✅ Complete with MR, issue, and discussion links
- **Code Suggestions**: ✅ Complete with language-specific syntax highlighting
- **Container Integration**: ✅ Complete with context-aware processing flags

### ✅ Features Implemented

1. **Context-Aware Processing Module** (`context_aware.ts`):
   - File/line context extraction from MR position data
   - Discussion thread context gathering
   - Enhanced response formatting with syntax highlighting
   - Language detection from file extensions (25+ languages supported)
   - Collapsible sections for better UX

2. **Enhanced Note Handler** (`note_enhanced.ts`):
   - Integrated context-aware processing into webhook handling
   - GitLab URL generation for reference links
   - Context-aware processing flags for container
   - Enhanced environment variable passing

3. **Container Integration**:
   - `CONTEXT_AWARE_PROCESSING` flag for container detection
   - `ENHANCED_CONTEXT` with processing metadata
   - File/line context variables: `FILE_PATH`, `LINE_NUMBER`, `CODE_CONTEXT`
   - Thread context variables: `THREAD_CONTEXT`, `DISCUSSION_ID`
   - Reference URLs: `MR_URL`, `ISSUE_URL`, `DISCUSSION_URL`

### ✅ Test Coverage
- **11/11 tests passing** for context-aware processing
- **3/3 tests passing** for enhanced note handler
- **8/8 tests passing** for context extraction functions
- Full test coverage for all implemented features

### ✅ Response Formatting Features
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Language-specific code blocks
- **Collapsible Sections**: Discussion history and commit info
- **Emoji Icons**: Visual indicators for different sections
- **Reference Links**: Direct links to GitLab resources
- **Context Indicators**: Clear indication of context-aware processing

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ MR comments include file/line information when available
- ✅ Code context is extracted and formatted properly with syntax highlighting
- ✅ Discussion thread context is included in responses with collapsible sections
- ✅ Responses are formatted based on trigger type with appropriate styling
- ✅ Code suggestions are highlighted and actionable with language detection
- ✅ Relevant GitLab links are included in responses

## Next Steps
Phase 4.1 is complete! The context-aware processing feature is fully implemented and tested. The enhanced GitLab webhook processing now provides:
- Rich context extraction from MR comments
- Intelligent response formatting
- Discussion thread awareness
- Direct GitLab integration links
- Language-specific syntax highlighting
