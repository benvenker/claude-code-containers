# GitLab Integration Feature Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for each phase of the GitLab integration implementation.

## Implementation Features

### Phase 2: Core GitLab Integration
- **@gitlab-worker-foundation.md** - Worker layer foundation with webhook handling
- **@gitlab-api-client.md** - GitLab API client with connection pooling and retry logic
- **@container-integration.md** - Container GitLab integration and processing modes

### Phase 3: Trigger Type Implementation
- **@gitlab-issues-processing.md** - GitLab issue processing with GitHub parity (✅ Complete)
- **@gitlab-comment-processing.md** - GitLab comment processing with @duo-agent (✅ Complete)
- **@gitlab-mr-processing.md** - GitLab MR processing with @duo-agent (✅ Complete)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- **@context-aware-processing.md** - Context-aware processing with enhanced formatting (✅ Complete)
- **@gitlab-multi-project-support.md** - Multi-project and group-level support (✅ Complete)

## Usage

Each feature document follows the same structure:
- **Overview** - Feature description and requirements
- **Implementation Status** - Current progress and test results
- **Technical Details** - Implementation notes and patterns
- **Success Criteria** - Definition of completion

## Development Process

All features are implemented using Test-Driven Development (TDD):
1. **RED** - Write failing tests
2. **GREEN** - Implement minimal working solution
3. **REFACTOR** - Improve code quality and optimize

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage across all GitLab features:
- Worker layer tests: 54 tests (including 15 webhook, 12 setup, 6 issue, 11 note, 10 MR handler tests)
- Container integration tests: 19 tests (GitLab API client and processing)
- **Total: 73 tests passing** (all GitLab integration tests)

## Next Steps

Phase 3 is now complete! Next would be Phase 4 (Advanced Features):
- Context-aware processing with file/line information
- Rate limiting and performance optimizations
- Advanced error handling and monitoring
