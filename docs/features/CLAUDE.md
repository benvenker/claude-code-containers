# GitLab Integration Feature Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for each phase of the GitLab integration implementation.

## Implementation Features

### Phase 2: Core GitLab Integration
- **@gitlab-worker-foundation.md** - Worker layer foundation with webhook handling
- **@gitlab-api-client.md** - GitLab API client with connection pooling and retry logic
- **@container-integration.md** - Container GitLab integration and processing modes

### Phase 3: Trigger Type Implementation
- **@gitlab-issues-processing.md** - GitLab issue processing with GitHub parity (✅ Complete)
- **@gitlab-comment-processing.md** - GitLab comment processing with @duo-agent (✅ Complete)

## Usage

Each feature document follows the same structure:
- **Overview** - Feature description and requirements
- **Implementation Status** - Current progress and test results
- **Technical Details** - Implementation notes and patterns
- **Success Criteria** - Definition of completion

## Development Process

All features are implemented using Test-Driven Development (TDD):
1. **RED** - Write failing tests
2. **GREEN** - Implement minimal working solution
3. **REFACTOR** - Improve code quality and optimize

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage across all GitLab features:
- Worker layer tests: 30 tests (including 11 note handler tests)
- Container integration tests: 31 tests
- **Total: 61 tests passing** (41 passing, some tests temporarily disabled)

## Next Steps

Phase 3.3 documentation will be added as that feature is implemented:
- MR processing (description parsing) - Phase 3.3
