# GitLab Container Issue Fix - Test Plan

## Issue Summary
The GitLab webhook was being processed but the container was not actually being invoked due to missing execution context handling. The async processing was being dropped because `ctx.waitUntil()` wasn't being used.

## Fix Applied
1. Added `ExecutionContext` parameter to the main worker fetch handler
2. Passed the context through the GitLab webhook handler chain
3. Used `ctx.waitUntil()` in the GitLab issue handler to ensure async container processing continues after the webhook response

## Test Steps

### 1. Verify GitLab Webhook Processing
- Create a new issue in your GitLab project
- Monitor the logs with: `npx wrangler tail --format=pretty`
- Expected behavior:
  - Should see "Routing to Claude Code container (async)"
  - Should NOT see continuous "Alarm" messages
  - Should see container invocation logs

### 2. Check Container Execution
- After creating the issue, look for:
  - "Starting Claude Code container processing" log
  - "Container request received" from the container
  - Container processing the GitLab issue context

### 3. Verify Issue Processing
- The container should:
  - Clone the GitLab repository
  - Process the issue with Claude Code
  - Either create a MR or post a comment on the issue

### 4. Monitor for Errors
- Check for any error logs in:
  - Worker logs (webhook processing)
  - Container logs (Claude Code execution)
  - GitLab API errors

## Troubleshooting

### If Container Still Not Invoked
1. Check that Claude API key is configured at `/claude-setup`
2. Verify GitLab token is valid and has correct permissions
3. Ensure the project ID matches the webhook sender

### If Alarm Messages Continue
- The alarm messages might be from a different Durable Object
- Check if they're related to the container lifecycle
- They may be normal background activity if not blocking functionality

## Success Criteria
✅ GitLab webhook returns 200 status quickly
✅ Container is invoked asynchronously
✅ No timeout errors from GitLab
✅ Issue is processed by Claude Code
✅ Response (MR or comment) appears on GitLab issue
